# E2E-TEST MONOREPO

A unified Playwright end-to-end (E2E) test suite that validates our **Skulibrary** AI-integrated related apps.  
The repository is designed to be approachable for both engineers _and_ non-technical stakeholders â€“ every test run generates an **Allure** report that can be browsed on GitHub Pages (Or if hosted officially somewhere).
